  ## Description 

  This team profile generator uses Node.js prompts to elicit responses from the user which will generate a styled html document populated with the responses received. There is a sample generated html called sampleIndex.html for viewing.
  This application was created with a TDD apporach and utilizes jest to test the inputs received by the user.
